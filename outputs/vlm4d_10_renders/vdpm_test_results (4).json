As the sequence continues the ball moves toward the batter and then onward to the left side of the plate and down the first-base line. The frames thus show the ball traveling from the right side of the frame toward the left.\n\nStep 2 — Trajectory visualization: The motion lines centered around the batter/catcher area are colored cyan on the right and transition to red on the left (cyan = earlier, red = later). That color gradient indicates motion from right → left.\n\nPutting both sources together, the ball clearly traveled from the right side of the scene toward the left.

In the video frames you can see the ball repeatedly moving down toward the court and back up near that player's body (typical dribble motion).\n- I tracked the ball across consecutive frames: it alternates between being close to the player's torso/legs and being low near the court surface several times, which are the dribble contacts.\n\nStep 2 — determine which hand is used for each dribble from the frames:\n- When the ball is on the player's left side (near his left leg) he reaches with his left hand; when it is on his right side he reaches with his right hand.\n- Examining the frames carefully, the ball is on the player’s left side (and the player’s left hand is extended toward it) on four distinct down‑up cycles while other cycles show it on the right side or being passed/held.\n\nStep 3 — confirm motion count and hand using the 3D trajectory visualization:\n- The 3D trajectory plot shows clusters of short, repeated up–down trajectories near the ball‑handler’s left side (these are the ball bounces), with the cyan→red color gradient marking time. Those clusters correspond to the moments the ball is bounced with the left hand.\n- The visualization shows four clear left‑side bounce trajectories (short, repeated vertical motions at successive times), supporting the frame‑by‑frame observation.\n\nCombining the frame sequence and the trajectory visualization, there are four distinct left‑hand dribble bounces.

On the swan’s neck and body the short motion vectors go from cyan (left) toward red (right), showing the head and body moved rightward over time.\n- The direction of those vectors around the neck indicates the swan turned so that the head moved from left to right in the view, i.e. a rotation that goes in the clockwise sense from the viewer’s perspective.\n\nStep 3 — Combine both pieces of evidence:\n- The frame-by-frame image sequence shows the head/neck moving rightward over time, and the trajectory plot confirms earlier (cyan) positions are left of later (red) positions on the neck/body.

From the frame-by-frame progression you can see the dancer’s body passes the same orientation multiple times in a continuous clockwise turning motion (as seen from the camera).\n\nStep 2 — Use the 3D trajectory visualization:\n- The trajectory visualization shows radial, circular paths centered near the dancer’s head. The color gradient (cyan → red) indicates time: cyan marks earlier positions and red marks later positions.\n- The radial strokes form about two full circular loops around the center: the cyan starting arc continues around once and then a second time before reaching the red end positions. The color progression along those circular lines confirms two main loops rather than many tightly packed turns.\n\nStep 3 — Combine both observations:\n- The frame-by-frame orientations match the two-loop structure seen in the trajectory image: the shoes and torso complete two clockwise passes around the head center during the recorded segment.\n- There are clearly more than zero, and far fewer than five or seven full rotations; the evidence supports two complete clockwise revolutions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C",
