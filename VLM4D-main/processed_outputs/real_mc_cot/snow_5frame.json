This indicates that there is movement occurring within the scene.  The question asks about the direction of a bus. Since motion is detected, it's likely that a vehicle (potentially a bus) is moving.\n\nWithout seeing the frames, we can only infer based on the motion detection.  Since the question asks *towards* which direction the bus is moving, we need to consider the overall movement observed.\n\nGiven the options, 'not moving' and 'there are no buses in the video' are clearly incorrect because motion is detected. 'Left' and 'right' are directional options.  Without seeing the frames, we can't determine if the bus is moving left or right.

This means we are relying solely on visual information from the video frames.\n\nSince the question asks about the direction of a thrown bat, we need to look for a change in the bat's position across the sampled frames.
