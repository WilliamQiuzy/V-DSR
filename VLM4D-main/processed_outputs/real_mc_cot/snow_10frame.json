Since we only have sampled frames and no detailed 3D information, we can only make an educated guess based on visual observation of the frames.\n\nI need to visually inspect the frames to identify instances of dribbling. Dribbling involves the person repeatedly tapping the ball with their hand, typically the right hand. I'll be looking for a consistent pattern of the right hand making contact with the ball.\n\nWithout actually viewing the frames, I can only provide a plausible estimate. Given that motion is detected, it's likely that the person is actively dribbling.
