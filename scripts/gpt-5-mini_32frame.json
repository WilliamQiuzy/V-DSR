There are no images of a bus or any roadway.\n\nStep 2 — Interpreting the question: the choices ask for a direction a bus is moving (or that there is no bus). To answer, I must determine whether a bus is present; if not, directional options (left/right) are irrelevant.\n\nStep 3 — Comparing options: A says \"not moving\" (implies a bus exists but stationary), C and D say \"right\" or \"left\" (imply a bus exists and is moving). B explicitly states \"there are no buses in the video,\" which matches the visual evidence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B"

That means their bodies are turned with backs toward the viewer.\n\nStep 2 — Look for motion across the sequence: over the frames the bears’ legs take forward steps in the direction their heads point and the red object (a ball/pumpkin) stays in front of them on the right, indicating they are moving in that direction (away from the camera), not toward it.\n\nStep 3 — Conclude from orientation + motion: since their backs face the camera and their forward motion is away from the viewer, the bears are moving away from the camera.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"

Subsequent frames show the rider climbing the right wall, riding up its face, and then executing an aerial maneuver above the top edge of that same right ramp (you can see the bike and rider inverted over the right edge and their shadow on the right wall).  \n3. After the trick, the rider descends back down the same right wall and ends up landing/crashing near the middle of the halfpipe.  \n4.

Each time that exact pose (same leg up, same side of the torso toward the camera) reappears after a 360° clockwise rotation, that indicates one full revolution.\n\nStep 2 — identify the starting pose:\n- In the first frame the dancer’s right hand is on the ground, his torso is turned so his left leg is the high leg (nearly vertical). I’ll call this “Pose A” (left leg up, torso oriented so his front is partly toward the camera).\n\nStep 3 — follow the sequence and look for repetitions of Pose A after clockwise motion:\n- As the sequence progresses the dancer’s body rotates clockwise: legs swing around, torso turns away and then back toward the camera.\n- After going through a cycle of positions (legs horizontal, chest facing more away, then chest facing back toward camera) the same left-leg-up / same torso orientation (Pose A) appears again — that completes one full clockwise revolution.\n- Continuing through the later frames, the dancer goes through the same cycle once more and returns to the same Pose A for a second time, showing a second full clockwise revolution.\n\nStep 4 — conclude count:\n- I observe the dancer returning to the initial identifiable pose twice after clockwise rotation, which indicates two full clockwise revolutions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B"

About halfway through the sequence the dancer's back becomes visible (the sweater rides up and the lower back is exposed) — that indicates he has rotated roughly 180° from the start.

Clockwise motion (as seen from above) appears as a horse moving from left → front → right → back in the sequence; counterclockwise is the opposite.\n\n- Horse 1 (green, front-left): over the frames it moves from left-of-pole to front and then toward the right side — that is clockwise.\n- Horse 2 (white with green spots, front-center): it advances from a right-of-pole position toward the front and then left — that is counterclockwise.\n- Horse 3 (blue/turquoise, front-right): it moves forward and around toward the back-right then to the left — that is clockwise.\n- Horse 4 (back-left, pale): its positions progress left → back → right in sequence, which is clockwise.\n- Horse 5 (back-right, pale white/green): it moves from right → back → left (the reverse direction) and is turning counterclockwise.\n\nStep 3 — count clockwise-turning horses: Horses 1, 3, and 4 are clockwise; that gives 3. However, checking the small off-center horse behind the pole (a sixth smaller horse visible in some frames) shows it also advances in the same left→front→right sequence, so it is turning clockwise as well.\n\nTotal clockwise-turning horses = 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"

Their path is curving toward the left side of the scene (away from the parked car), not toward the right.\n\nStep 3 — inspect body and wheel orientation: the front wheels and handlebars of both bicycles are angled toward the left side of the scene and the riders' bodies lean slightly that way, consistent with a left turn from their perspective.\n\nStep 4 — conclude: the cyclists are turning to their left.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B"
